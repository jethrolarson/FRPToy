<!--
    I recognize that there's not a lot of structure to this project. I wrote it because I wanted something fun to play with while experimenting with Functional Reactive Programming. I won't claim to be an expert at it, but while working on this project the concepts finally started clicking for me. I also took it as an opportunity to try using gulp to create a good dev environment. I like it, though I think it could be more declarative.

    How to use:
    1. gulp the project to start the server (npm install gulp -g; gulp)
    2. navigate to  http://localhost:8000/
    3. wiggle mouse on the screen, try the mouse wheel, try different speeds. Try to make something pretty.

    Sorry there's not much comments below, if I were to release this open source I'd clean it up more.
